 * Password Reset Workflow Test
 * 
 * This file demonstrates the complete password reset workflow:
 * 1. User visits forgot_password.php
 * 2. User enters email and submits form
 * 3. forgot_password_process.php generates token and sends email
 * 4. User clicks link in email to visit reset_password.php?token=xxx
 * 5. User enters new password and submits form
 * 6. reset_password_process.php validates token and updates password
 * 7. User is automatically logged in and redirected to profile

echo "Files involved in the password reset process:\n";
echo "1. forgot_password.php - Form to request password reset\n";
echo "2. auth/forgot_password_process.php - Generates reset token and sends email\n";
echo "3. reset_password.php - Form to enter new password (with token validation)\n";
echo "4. auth/reset_password_process.php - Processes new password and logs user in\n";
echo "5. profile.php - Shows success message after password reset\n\n";

echo "Database requirements:\n";
echo "- Users table must have 'reset_token' and 'reset_expires' columns\n";
echo "- These columns should allow NULL values\n\n";

echo "Security features:\n";
echo "- Tokens are cryptographically secure (32 bytes)\n";
echo "- Tokens expire after 1 hour\n";
echo "- Password validation (minimum 6 characters)\n";
echo "- Password confirmation required\n";
echo "- Tokens are cleared after successful password reset\n";
echo "- User is automatically logged in after successful reset\n\n";

echo "To test the workflow:\n";
echo "1. Visit http://localhost/login/forgot_password.php\n";
echo "2. Enter a valid email address from your users table\n";
echo "3. Check the database for the generated reset_token\n";
echo "4. Visit http://localhost/login/reset_password.php?token=YOUR_TOKEN\n";
echo "5. Enter a new password and confirm it\n";
echo "6. You should be automatically logged in and see a success message\n";
